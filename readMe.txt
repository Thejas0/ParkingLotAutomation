Hii ,
This file will contain information about the codes  and how to run it .

So their are 3 main aspect of code :
- oneWay Perpendicular(block size 1*1) 
- TwoWay Perpendicular(block size>=2 )
- TwoWay Angular (block size>=2)

Run the code accourding to the requirements .

Too run the code the pre-requists are:

File to run for creating simularion :
    - For angled parking with block size>=2
        angledMainInputs.py  -> angledMain.py
        (in the input folder mention all the paramters like filename)
     - For Perpendicular parking with block size>=2
        perpMainInputs.py  -> perpMain.py
        (in the input folder mention all the paramters like filename)
     - For oneway Perpendicular parking with block size = 1
        oneWayMainPerpInputs.py  -> oneWayMainPerp.py
        (in the input folder mention all the paramters like filename)


- proper input format 
    i would have attached some example txt file which my code would take as an
    input refer those 
    general format will be as
    parameters(no of rows,cols,length and width of driveway and parkinglot) -> entry cell -> flowvariables(f) -> parkinglot (x)
    *no extra lines

- run appropriate Input.py
    for example oneWayMainPerpInputs ,perpMainInputs , angularMainInputs
    change the appropriate filename in the python file like filename ,blocklength and width etc
    save the file

- run appropriate main.py file 
    the simulation should run
    (note - run in VSCode interactewindow )

If any issue refer problems.txt file I have attached few common problem which the code might fall oneWay
If the problem persists try restarting the pc(IDE) xD (universal solution)

Contact me, if still the problem persists
