So I hope the code wors fine bu in case you run into some error these might be few error

Connection of Vissim :
    Make sure that Input.py file is run first and the Vissim environment is created and then run the main.py file

Input error:
    Make sure that the input to the file are in proper format,refer few exiting file format
    make sure they are in the same directory

Sytax Error :
    You might get list index out of bound , then just increase the size of the list which gives this erros

Function error:
    If an any function gives an error, if the function is related to preproceesing the data or connecting to vissim,
    just try printing the grid array (3D) which is passed to the function and check where the code fails 

Error in simulation:
    I would have attached 3 individual python files(about 1000 lines of code) were all functions will be in one file try running the code in that file if that works
    name of those files(oneWayperpReduced,DifferentDrivelaneAngled,DifferentDrivelanePerp) for 2x2 lane( AngledReducedLinkFinal(1),perpReducedLinkMain)
    Their might be for few corner case were the routing decison of parkinglot fail

Connection,routing error: 
    Try running the appropriateindividual python files(about 1000+ lines of code) were all functions will be in one file try running the code in that file if that works
    name of those files(oneWayperpReduced(for driveway size 1),DifferentDrivelaneAngled(angled parking of driveway size>=2),DifferentDrivelanePerp(perpendincular parking driveway >=2)) for 2x2 lane( AngledReducedLinkFinal(1),perpReducedLinkMain)

Debugging code might be a difficult task , so my best wishes are with you :P 

If still the problem persists 
contact me ;)
